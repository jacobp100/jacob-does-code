## TechniCalc is every bit functional as it is beautiful.

The modern interface that makes a clean break from traditional pocket calculators. Equations are entered in a natural way, adhering to every detail of hand-written maths.

The _advanced maths engine_ also makes this the only calculator you&rsquo;ll ever need.

You&rsquo;ll find your garden variety logs, sins, and cosines &mdash; but for when you need it, the engine has full support for imaginary numbers, vectors, matrices, sums and products, and differentiation and integration.

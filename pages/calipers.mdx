## A 5 meter tape measure.

Measure **centimeters** and **inches** right on your phone screen.

For larger measurements, just slide your phone across a surface. As you do, Calipers will show you a summary of the meters or feet measured.

Markings along the ruler let you record lengths at multiple intervals. Once you're done, Calipers can calculate the relative distances between each interval.

## Precision Measurements.

You can measure anything that fits on your phone screen down to the **tenth of a millimeter**. Just place an object on your phone screen and adjust the two markers until they just touch the edges of the object, and Calipers will give you a precise length.

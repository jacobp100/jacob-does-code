# Jacob Parker

<Lead>Senior frontend and mobile with over **9 years React** and **8 years React Native** experience. Skilled in everything relating to JavaScript, CSS, and iOS development.</Lead>

<p className={classNames('keywords')}>I've my career focused **JavaScript** projects using **React**, **React Native**, and anything related. I've got over 7 years' experience with all the tools you'd expect: **TypeScript**, **Jest**, **NodeJS**, **ExpressJS**, **Webpack**, **Babel**, **ESLint**, **Yarn**, **ES6**, and 3 years' **GraphQL**. I have extensive experience building application architectures that scale to support every requirement from product and design: I see my job as making things happen, and almost never say something cannot be done.</p>

#### React & Web

<p className={classNames('keywords')}>For **React**, I've used just about everything &mdash; **Redux**, **React Router**, **MobX**, **React Intl**, and many more. I have an incredibly strong understanding of everything CSS, have used just about every tool there is, and even written my own. Whether you're using **Styled Components**, **SASS**, **postCSS**, **CSS Modules**, or **vanilla CSS** &mdash; or if you don't have an architecture for your CSS &mdash; I can help.</p>

#### React Native

<p className={classNames('keywords')}>If you're using **React Native**, you're probably using some of my code! I maintain the *safe-area-context* package (used by **react-navigation**), developed the CSS engine for *Styled Components*, helped implement the *gap* and *transform-origin* properties, and added a bunch of fixes to modals. I've worked on a tonne of apps, and never accept React Native cannot do something &mdash; I'll make it!</p>

#### Polyglot

I have experience in a lot more than I can fit on my CV, including backend experience, functional programming, and if there's something new, I'll learn it!

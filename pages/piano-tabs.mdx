## Over 800 pieces included. Import your own for anything else.

Piano Tabs includes a giant library of classical pieces with over **800 pieces** from over **90 composers**.

If that's not enough, you can import your own MIDI files. They're the industry standard, and **super-easy** to get hold of.

Pieces are displayed as you would play them on a keyboard, so there is **no learning curve** to get started.

Scroll through a piece for **interactive playback** to help you either find or study a section.

## Loop sections. Practise until perfect.

Looping lets you pick specific parts of the piece you want to practise. Just drag the top and bottom handles set the start and end of the loop.

With a loop set up up, you can use the **speed trainer** to have it start each loop playing slowly, and gradually speed up after each loop. Tweak how slow it starts, and how many loops it takes to reach the full tempo.

## Make your mark. Annotate anywhere.

Bookmarks let you mark out sections within a piece. You can add as many as you need.

Use your finger or Apple Pencil to **freehand draw anywhere** in the piece to annotate.\*

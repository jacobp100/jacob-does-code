## Open any song.

Key Lines works with any MIDI file. They're the industry standard, and _super-easy_ to get hold of.

Pieces are displayed as you would play them on a keyboard, so there is _no learning curve_ to get started.

Scroll through a piece for _interactive playback_ to help you either find or study a section.

## Loop sections. Practise until perfect.

Looping lets you pick specific parts of the piece you want to practise. Just drag the top and bottom handles set the start and end of the loop.

With a loop set up up, you can use the _speed trainer_ to have it start each loop playing slowly, and gradually speed up after each loop. Tweak how slow it starts, and how many loops it takes to reach the full tempo.

## Make your mark. Annotate anywhere.

Bookmarks let you mark out sections within a piece. You can add as many as you need.

Use your finger or Apple Pencil to _freehand draw anywhere_ in the piece to annotate.\*

## Customise every aspect of playback.

View every track within a MIDI file, and _change the key and tempo_ to your liking.

_Percussion tracks_ play along side the active track, or can be swapped out for a standard click _metronome_, or silenced entirely.
